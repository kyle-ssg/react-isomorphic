# React Isomorphic
Intended for static sites and web applications that also need server-side rendering.
Around 57.5KB Compressed JS.

This automatically renders exactly the same React markup between client and server without config.

## Getting Started
**This will get you all setup and running ðŸš€**
```
git clone https://github.com/kyle-ssg/react-isomorphic.git && cd react-isomorphic && rm -rf .git && git init && npm install && npm start
```

### Run Dev - Run hot reloading node server
```
$ npm start
```

### Run Prod - Build, deploy, minify, cachebust and run production node server
```
$ npm run prod
```

### New Pages
Simply add a route to ```routes.js```. Wrap pages in ```DocumentTitle``` elements and a ```div``` child. 

*DocumentTitle elements allow you to manage the title of your page, it gets interpreted both on the server and client for seo purposes.*

If you wish the page to be completely static (Unlikely) you will need to add an entry to ```pages.js``` and add a corresponding handlebars template.


### Images/fonts etc
/fonts and /images always get deployed, if you wish to add more static folders you'll need to edit ```plugins.js```.

Static files are always served at the root, this means you just have to do ```<img src='/images/yourfile.png/>``` and ```background-image:url('/images/yourfile.png')```.

### Dev Notes
- In dev mode the css is rendered in the body meaning you will see a flicker while it gets interpreted, this is for performance and doesn't happen in production.
- In dev mode you may get a warning about the server/client markup being out of sync, this error can be ignored as it is just a knockon affect from hot reloading.

### Project breakdown

#### Develop
- Node server kicked off and managed by Nodemon, this only watches server related files in order to preserve hot reloading.
- Server uses ```webpack-dev-middleware``` and ```webpack-hot-middleware```. The config (```webpack.config.dev```) takes ```main.js``` as the entry in order to compile the react app + css.
- All requests serve index.handlebars, this behaviour is controlled by ```single-page-middleware.js```. 
- Requests use req.url and server render components based on the configuration in ```routes.js```. The handlebars template also loads ```main.js``` in order to kick off client-side rendering. 

The rest can be considered as a pretty vanilla react application. 

#### Production
This can be for the most part be treated the same as development with the following differences:

- Node env is set to production.
- ```main.js``` is minified and a hash is added to the filename (to prevent caching).
- Styles generated from ```styles.scss``` are extracted and outputted to a hashed/minified style.css file.
- The hashed js and css files are injected to the handlebars templates (defined in ```pages.js```) via the ```HtmlWebpackPlugin```.
